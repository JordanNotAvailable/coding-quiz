# Demo-Coding-Quiz

## Description

This demo project was built from scratch consisting of HTML, CSS aand JavaScript code and was used to test what I've been learning and how to apply it into a working site and that was done by creating a coding quiz. In doing this it helped me understand more on how to make a dynamic page using js to access the html elements on loop.
